      <description>The weather in Grantue wasn&amp;rsquo;t the most pleasant that day. Mostly misty, but here and there it was raining. No-one could be seen on the streets, though it had more to do with the recent outbreak of a disease and the general reluctance of the Grantue citizens to go out unless absolutely necessary. But I, I actually liked that high humidity, lack of wind and vague temperature.
And there I was, with soaked glasses in the pockets, returning home from the meeting that could have taken place on a videoconference but didn&amp;rsquo;t. I was angry, but every droplet of rain reduced my anger a bit and when I finally got home, I was already calmed, leaving a path of angry droplets behind me.</description>
