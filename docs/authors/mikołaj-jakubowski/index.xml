      <description>Introduction In this blog, we summarize the work of our colleagues from the same faculty: Correlation between reproducibility of research papers and their objective. They used more than 30 papers coming from The R Journal in order to do research on the reproducibility of scientific papers.
But what is reproducibility? The easiest way to describe reproducibility is &amp;lsquo;the part&amp;rsquo; of the given article that we can obtain by ourselves using the attached code in its chunks. By &amp;lsquo;the part&amp;rsquo; can be meant the real fraction of the article (the same plots and tables) or simply the existence of sources and creating approximated results - just to show the tendency of some variables in a data set.</description>
